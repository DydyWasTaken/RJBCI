# RJBCI

The roblox Jailbreak car importer made by DydyWastaken with the help of Hazed_Mist.

This is the first release version, so expect bugs that gonna be fixed with time, also this version is for manual users, you gonna have to configure yourself the cars and then save them before using theses.
# How does it works ?

Well, it basicaly replaces the car model you're sitting in, and then places a model you imported with an id, everything on client side since accessing server scripts with a exploit is nearly impossible.

For cutomization, it's streaming the original color of the real car, since the real car become only invisible and not deleted, same method for textures, Windows tint, material reflectance and much more.

Stats of the car are in developement and some of them dont work yet, it modifies the real stats though modules and for now it's extremely unstable so that's why for now i won't explain how to use this part.

# Requirements

-Synapse X at https://x.synapse.to/ or krnl at https://krnl.vip/ (any other executor won't work or not gonna save presets)

-A vip server for a secure usage (with updates you won't be able to use this in any public server)

-As always, a good pc

# Choosing the vehicle

For each car, you need to choose a base car depending on the Second body color being available or not, car size, number of interior colors;

-For monoplaces like f1 concepts etc, use base cars like airtail with a central seat or the mcl35m (F1)

-If your car has 2 body colors nor 2 interior color, use cars like ray9 or Bolide

-The car is big nor has big wheels/rims ? use cars like fire truck, sentinel or arachnid

## Checkboxes:

Here, you can tell to the importer what the car you imported have or not by checking or uncheking boxes
